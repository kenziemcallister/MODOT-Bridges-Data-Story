# MODOT Briges Data Story

Infrastructure is known to be the backbone of transportation. In Missouri, a state sitting at the crossroads of America, bridges play a crucial role in connecting highways across rivers and valleys, ensuring efficient transportation for commerce and commuters. According to the Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT), there are over 10,000 bridges within the state, the sixth most in the country (Missouri Department of Transportation, 2024). This data story aims to explore the condition, distribution, and necessary improvements of Missouriâ€™s bridges. By analyzing these factors, we can identify areas requiring greater attention, and inform plans for future reconstruction and budgeting.
